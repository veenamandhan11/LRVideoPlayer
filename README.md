This project is an iOS application developed in `Swift` that replicates interactive live streaming. 

<details>
<summary>Task Description</summary>

- Create a full screen collection view cell with a video player that loads video from a json file.
  - Video should automatically play and loop.
  - Display username, profilePicURL, viewers, and likes.
  - When a user swipes up or down, the video player and overlaid controls should swipe to the next cell. 
  - Each cell should display full screen, so that only one player is visible at a time.

- After a video loads, display mock comments in a transparent table view that scrolls new content into view every 2 seconds.
  - Each comment should display the username, profilePictureURL, and comment.
  - The comments scroll should have a transparent background with white text and gray text for the userâ€™s name.

- Allow tapping the comment text field so that the keyboard comes up and pushes all the UI up.

- After a comment is added, put it into the comments scroll and scroll the other comments up with animation.
